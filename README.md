# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

## Port Already in Use

    PORT=4000 npm run dev
    ```
# SQLite Binding Issues (If using better-sqlite3)

If you run into issues with better-sqlite3 bindings, try rebuilding the bindings:

    ```bash
    npm rebuild better-sqlite3
    ```
## Missing Dependencies

# 🎯 Future Enhancements

#### Persistent storage for sql.js
Currently, the database is stored in memory. We plan to implement persistent storage using IndexedDB in the browser.

#### Integration with third-party analytics APIs
We may integrate with services like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to gather insights.

#### Email notifications
We plan to add email notifications for account updates and other events.
